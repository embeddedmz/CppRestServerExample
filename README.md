# C++ REST Server Example

Example taken from this blog article : https://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2017/11/19/revisited-full-fledged-client-server-example-with-c-rest-sdk-2-10/

With GCC 4.8.5 (Centos 7) and the latest versions of cpprest-sdk and Boost, I'm experiencing crashes related to Boost when closing "Postman" (a tool to test REST APIs) or when trying to print exceptions.
